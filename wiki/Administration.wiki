#summary Sample application for a simple administrative interface.
#labels chapter,1.0,draft

This sample application is full of comments, so it's a good way to learn Wheels if
you prefer playing around with code rather than reading more abstract tutorials.

This sample application covers how to set up validation rules on a model, make a form for it, save to the database, and so on.

==Instructions==

Create a new database with a table named `users` containing the following columns:

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Nullable* || *Primary Key* ||
|| id || int, identity || No || Yes ||
|| firstname || varchar(100) || No || No ||
|| lastname || varchar(100) || No || No ||
|| email || varchar(100) || No || No ||
|| password || varchar(20) || No || No ||

Add a data source in the !ColdFusion or Railo Administrator named `cfwheelsUserAdministration`, pointing to your new database.

Once that's all done, just download, unzip, and run the application. (It includes
with !ColdFusion on Wheels 1.0.)
