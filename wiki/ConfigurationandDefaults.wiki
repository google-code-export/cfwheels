#summary An overview of Wheels configuration and how is it used in your applications. Learn how to override a Wheels convention to make it your own.
#labels chapter,1.0,published_prod

We all love the "Convention over Configuration" motto of Wheels, but what about those two cases that pop into everyone's head? _What if I want to develop in my own way?_ Or, _What about an existing application that I need to port into Wheels?_ Gladly, that's what configuration and defaults are there for. Let's take a look at exactly how is this performed.

==Where Configurations Happen==

You will find configuration files in the `config` folder of your Wheels application. In general, most of your settings will go in `config/settings.cfm`.

You can also set values based on what environment you have set. For example, you can have different values for your settings depending on whether you're in `design` mode or `production` mode. See the chapter on [SwitchingEnvironments Switching Environments] for more details.

==How to Set Configurations==

To change a Wheels application default, you generally use the [set set()] function. With it, you can perform all sorts of tweaks to the framework's default behaviors.

==Types of Configurations Available==

There are several types of configurations that you can perform in Wheels to override all those default behaviors. In Wheels, you can find all these configuration options:

 * URL rewrite settings 
 * Data source settings
 * Environment settings
 * Caching settings
 * Function settings
 * Miscellaneous settings

Let's take a closer look at each of these options.

===URL Rewrite Settings===

Sometimes it is useful for our applications to "force" URL rewriting. By default, Wheels will try to determinate what type of URL rewriting to perform and set it up for you. But you can force in or out this setting by using the example below:

{{{
<cfset set(urlRewriting="Off")>
}}}

The code above will tell Wheels to skip its automatic detection of the URL Rewriting capabilities and just set it as "Off".

You can also set it to "Partial" if you believe that your web server is capable of rewriting the URL as folders after `index.cfm`.

For more information, read the chapter about [URLRewriting URL Rewriting].

===Data Source Settings===

Probably the most important configuration of them all. What is an application without a database to store all of its precious data?

The data source configuration is what tells Wheels which database to use for all of its models. (This can be overridden on a per model basis, but that will be covered later.) To set this up in Wheels, it's just as easy as the previous example:

{{{
<cfset set(dataSourceName="yourDataSourceName")>
<cfset set(dataSourceUserName="yourDataSourceUsername")>
<cfset set(dataSourcePassword="yourDataSourcePassword")> 
}}}

===Environment Settings===

Not only are the environments useful for separating your production settings from your "under development" settings, but they are also opportunities for you to override settings that will only take effect in a specified environment.

For example, let's say that we want to disable debugging information in our `development` environment temporarily:

{{{
<!--- /config/development/settings.cfm --->
<cfset set(showDebugInformation=false)>
}}}

====Full Listing of Environment Settings====

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Default* || *Description* ||
|| `showDebugInformation` || `boolean` || Enabled in `design` and `development` || When set to `true`, Wheels will show debugging information in the footers of your pages. ||
|| `showErrorInformation` || `boolean` || Enabled in `design`, `development`, `maintenance`, and `testing` || When set to `false`, Wheels will run and display code stored at `events/onerror.cfm` instead of revealing CFML errors. ||
|| `sendEmailOnError` || `boolean` || Enabled in `production` environments that have a TLD like `.com`, `.org`, etc. || When set to `true`, Wheels will send an email to administrators whenever Wheels throws an error. ||
|| `errorEmailAddress` || `string` || `[empty string]` || Comma-delimited list of email address to send error notifications to. Only applies if `sendEmailOnError` is set to `true`. ||

For more information, refer to the chapter about [SwitchingEnvironments Switching Environments].

===Caching Settings===

Wheels does a pretty good job at caching the framework and its output to speed up your application. But if personalization is key in your application, finer control over caching settings will become more important.

Let's say your application generates dynamic routes and you need it to check the routes on each request. This task will be as simple as this line of code:

{{{
<cfset set(cacheRoutes=false)>
}}}

====Full Listing of Caching Settings====

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Default* || *Description* ||
|| `cacheDatabaseSchema` || `boolean` || Enabled in `development`, `maintenance`, `testing` and `production` || When set to `false`, you can add a field to the database, and Wheels will pick that up right away. ||
|| `cacheFileChecking` || `boolean` || Enabled in `development`, `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache whether or not controller, helper and layout files exist ||
|| `cacheImages` || `boolean` || Enabled in `development`, `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache general image information used in [imageTag imageTag()] like width and height. ||
|| `cacheModelInitialization` || `boolean` || Enabled in `development`, `maintenance`, `testing` and `production` || When set to `false`, any changes you make to the `init()` function in the model file will be picked up immediately. ||
|| `cacheControllerInitialization` || `boolean` || Enabled in `development`, `maintenace`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `false`, any changes you make to the `init()` function in the controller file will be picked up immediately. ||
|| `cacheRoutes` || `boolean` || Enabled in `development`, `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache routes across all pageviews. ||
|| `cacheActions` || `boolean` || Enabled in `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache output generated by actions when specified (in a [caches caches()] call for example). ||
|| `cachePages` || `boolean` || Enabled in `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache output generated by a view page when specified (in a [renderPage renderPage()] call for example). ||
|| `cachePartials` || `boolean` || Enabled in `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache output generated by partials when specified (in a [includePartial includePartial()] call for example). ||
|| `cacheQueries` || `boolean` || Enabled in `maintenance`, `testing`, and `production` || When set to `true`, Wheels will cache SQL queries when specified (in a [findAll findAll()] call for example). ||
|| `maximumItemsToCache` || `numeric` || `5000` || Maximum number of items to store in Wheels's cache at one time. When the cache is full, items will be deleted automatically at a regular interval based on the other cache settings. ||
|| `cacheCullPercentage` || `numeric` || `10` || If you set this value to `10`, then at most, 10% of expired items will be deleted from the cache. ||
|| `cacheCullInterval` || `numeric` || `5` || Number of minutes between each culling action. The reason the cache is not culled during each request is to keep performance as high as possible. ||
|| `defaultCacheTime` || `numeric` || `60` || Number of minutes an item should be cached when it has not been specifically set through one of the functions that perform the caching in Wheels (i.e., [caches caches()], [findAll findAll()], [includePartial includePartial()], etc.) ||

For more information, refer to the chapter on [Caching].

===Function Settings===

OK, here it's where the fun begins! Wheels includes a lot of functions to make your life as a CFML developer easier. A lot of those functions have sensible default argument values to minimize the amount of code that you need to write. And yes, you guessed it, Wheels lets you override those default argument values application-wide.

Let's look at a little of example:

{{{
<cfset set(functionName="findAll", perPage=20)>
}}}

That little line of code will make all calls to the `findAll` method in Wheels return a maximun number of 20 record per page (if pagination is enabled for that `findAll` call). How great is that? You don't need to set the `perPage` value for every single call to `findAll` if you have a different requirement than the Wheels default of 10 records.

===Miscellaneous Settings===

How about situations that don't fit into those previous 5 categories? Well, they all fall right into this miscellaneous section.

Let's say you don't like the convention name for the soft delete feature of Wheels. Changing it is as easy as this:

{{{
  <cfset set(softDeleteProperty="trashedAt")>
}}}

This will enable soft delete on all models that contains the `trashedAt` property instead of the Wheels default, `deletedAt`.

====Full Listing of Miscellaneous Settings====

|| *Name* || *Type* || *Default* || *Description* ||
|| `tableNamePrefix` || `string` || `[empty string]` || String to prefix all database tables with so you don't need to define your model objects including it. Useful in environments that have table naming conventions like starting all table names with `tbl` ||
|| `obfuscateURLs` || `boolean` || `false` || Set to `true` to obfuscate primary keys in URLs. ||
|| `reloadPassword` || `string` || `[empty string]` || Password to require when reloading the Wheels application from the URL. Leave empty to require no password. ||
|| `softDeleteProperty` || `string` || `deletedAt` || Name of database column that Wheels will look for in order to enforce soft deletes. ||
|| `timeStampOnCreateProperty` || `string` || `createdAt` || Name of database column that Wheels will look for in order to automatically store a "created at" time stamp when records are created. ||
|| `timeStampOnUpdateProperty` || `string` || `updatedAt` || Name of the database column that Wheels will look for in order to automatically store an "updated at" time stamp when records are updated. ||
|| `ipExceptions` || `string` || `[empty string]` || IP addresses that Wheels will ignore when the environment is set to `maintenance`. That way administrators can test the site while in maintenance mode, while the rest of users will see the message loaded in `events/onmaintenance.cfm`. ||
|| `overwritePlugins` || `boolean` || `true` || When set to `true`, Wheels will overwrite plugin files based on their source zip files on application reload. Setting this to `false` makes plugin development easier because you don't need to keep rezipping your plugin files every time you make a change. ||

===Wrapping It Up===

There are literally hundreds of configurations options in Wheels for you to play around with. So go ahead and sink your teeth into Wheels configuration and defaults.
