Database transactions are a way of grouping multiple queries together. They are useful in case the outcome of one query depends on the completion of another. For example, if you want to take money from one person's bank account, and transfer it into someone else's, you want to make sure the debit completes before running the credit.

You'll be pleased to know that Wheels makes using database transactions easy. In fact, for the vast majority of the time you won't need to think about using them at all, as Wheels automatically runs all queries within the callback chain within a transaction for creates, updates and deletes.

<cffunction name="init">
	<cfset afterCreate(methods="createFirstPost")>
</cffunction>

<cffunction name="createFirstPost")>
	<cfset var post = model("Post").new(authorId=this.id, text="This is my first post!")>
	<cfreturn post.save()>
</cffunction>
